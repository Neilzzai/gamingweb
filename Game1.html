          <p>Like many, I’ve been waiting for a truly excellent Harry Potter game since I was in the third grade. In that time, we’ve gotten some respectable LEGO Potter games,
             an underwhelming EA Sports Quidditch game for some reason, and even suffered through the fevered nightmare that is Harry Potter Kinect. But none of these has come 
             close to fulfilling that fantasy of receiving a Hogwarts admission letter that opens the door to a secret world. With Hogwarts Legacy, I’m happy to say that we finally 
             got a Harry Potter game that captures some of that magic. Its open world map absolutely nails the vibe of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, it has spellcasting
              combat that’s stupefyingly good, the characters that inhabit it are charming and unforgettable, and it is positively brimming with countless diversions to soak up dozens
               of hours of your time. It may not be the most impressive technical achievement and it is certainly cursed with a lack of enemy variety, but none of Hogwarts Legacy’s issues
                can cast a Descendo charm on this triumphant visit to the Wizarding World.</p>

          <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Piece Odyssey</h3>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>

          <span class="fa fa-star-half-full checked"></span>
          <p>A classic turn-based RPG in the style of Dragon Quest is not exactly the first place my mind goes when it comes to thinking of game genres that would pair well with the action-heavy 
            world of One Piece, but as One Piece Odyssey proves, it’s actually kind of a great fit. The Straw Hats make for one hell of a party of RPG characters; Eichiro Oda’s one-of-a-kind art
             style lends itself well to filling the world with fantastical and amusing creatures; and the over-the-top nature of battles from the actual manga and anime gives plenty of material 
             for some of the coolest (and funniest) special attacks I’ve seen in any turn-based RPG. Those fights would’ve been better if they were a more consistent challenge, and I could’ve done
              with less backtracking through areas I’d already explored, but this is still a surprisingly satisfying JRPG that’s not quite by the numbers.</p>

          <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World of Warcraft: Dragonflight Review</h3>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star "></span>
          <p>Most recent World of Warcraft expansions started with a tightly scripted, story-heavy, and somewhat bothersome on-rails scenario. Dragonflight seems to have remembered that this is an 
            MMORPG and I should be deciding what kind of adventures I want to go on. Right off the boat onto the expansive, beautiful Dragon Isles, you'll be met with only minimal handholding and 
            four huge, exciting zones to explore. But at the same time, Dragonflight feels like a creative step backwards from the experimental – though not always successful – spirit of Shadowlands.</p>

          <p>By their very competitive, dog-eat-dog nature, battle royale games don’t tend to be about making friends with the people you meet. But with its big 2.0 revamp, Call of Duty: Warzone has made
             some admirable efforts toward inspiring us to work together, communicate, and socialize even as we fight to be the last ones standing. Some of its other new ideas don’t pay off quite as well, 
             such as the relatively bland new map and its ill-advised backpack system. But even if you put all of that aside, the introduction of an excellent new PvPvE mode is more than reason enough to 
             round up a squad and drop back into Warzone for a few matches. After all, the real victory screen might just be the friends we made along the way.</p>

          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <p>No other racing game released this year looks quite like Need for Speed Unbound, and that can be a difficult thing to achieve in such an established genre so steeped in convention. Criterion 
            has gone all-in with wild, animated visual flair that often appears as though it’s been lifted from the pages of a comic book, even as the actual driving and split day/night structure of its 
            races are immediately familiar to those of us who appreciated 2019’s Need for Speed Heat. The result is a uniquely styled racer that regularly looks quite fabulous in motion, though its grating 
            story mode goes over like a banana in the tailpipe and the online mode simply feels stripped down and unfinished.</p></div>
